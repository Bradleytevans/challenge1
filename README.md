A challenge from my UCF Bootcamp to take existing code and refractor it by adding html semantic HTML elements that follow proper and logical structure, as well as adding alt attributes to the images. They're was also some broken links and and a missing title that was adressed. Combined some of the CSS coding as well and made it more organized and flow with the page.
